# Taman Pintar

It's basically just a simple app, I made this app based on the website https://tamanpintar.co.id/. It doesn't connect to internet nor linked to the website. Actually this is my first "big?" Android project. The content is still at minimum. The another reason why I made this is, I have a lot of time to learn. I want to learn more.
